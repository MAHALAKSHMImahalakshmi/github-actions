# 🧩 name: firstpipeline
# This sets the name of your workflow. It's just a label to help you identify it in the GitHub Actions UI.

# 🚀 on: [push]
# This defines the trigger for the workflow.

# push means the workflow will run every time someone pushes code to the repository (e.g., commits to any branch).

# 🛠️ jobs
# A job is a set of steps that run in the same environment.

# You can have multiple jobs running in parallel or sequentially.

# In your example, there's one job named first.

# 🖥️ runs-on: ubuntu-latest
# This specifies the virtual machine (runner) that will execute the job.

# ubuntu-latest means it will run on the latest version of Ubuntu Linux.

# Alternatives include windows-latest or macos-latest.

# 📋 steps
# These are the individual commands or actions that run inside the job.

# Each step can run a shell command or use a prebuilt GitHub Action.

# yaml
# - name: step 1
#   run: echo "Ganesha"
# name: A label for the step (optional but useful for readability).

# run: The actual shell command that will be executed.

# You have two steps here, both using echo to print messages to the console.
